# Challenge_1_HTML_And_CSS_Intro

## Description

Review and improve HTML and CSS Code to make descriptive HTML tags, make sure links work, make sure headers follow a correct order, learn how CSS elements, id's, and classes work, and HTML structure. The project contained a lot of div elements. By learning different HTML tags, I learned more how to apply CSS, and better standards on constructing web pages. I was able to comment out section of HTML and CSS and add new changes to the structure of the page. I was able to reduce redundancy on CSS classes as well.
